## del key not working
Add `set enable-keypad on` to `/etc/inputrc` or `~/.inputrc`.

## st in combination with the suckless scroll program

You can also find the suckless scroll program in this repository which,
when enabled in the st config.h file, will add scrollback to st and text 
will NOT be cut off anymore when resizing the terminal window. BUT scroll 
is still experimental and therefore contains bugs.

### How to install scroll

```
cd scroll
sudo make clean install
```
